    <h2>Why my petition matters</h2>

    <p>
      My views are also supported by these activists and thinkers:
      <strong>Lawrence Lessig, Rick Falkvinge, Cory Doctorow</strong>, and others.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Reasons I believe copyright needs reform or should end completely:</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        I came to the conclusion that culture can't be owned by one entity.
        Everything is created through people, not by people — we are one consciousness.
        Ideas released into the world are free.
        <br><em>(As argued in the book <strong>Free Culture</strong> by Lawrence Lessig.)</em>
      </li>

      <li>
        We should have the right to film and record in our own homes without
        second-guessing or seeking permission when sharing non-profit culture.
        Things in our own home should be ours.
      </li>

      <li>
        People contribute to culture by sharing. Culture is essential and a
        fundamental human right practiced for centuries.
        Sadly, in the digital age, this right is becoming more restricted than ever before.
      </li>

      <li>
        There needs to be a balance between the public and original artists —
        protecting creators without limiting culture itself.
      </li>

      <li>
        Limiting culture is impossible. People will keep creating regardless,
        and culture will always build on the past.
      </li>
    </ol>
